# Python Oil & Gas Playground

This repository contains small exercises, experiments, and workflow prototypes related to:
- Petrophysics  
- Geomechanics  
- Drilling engineering  
- Reservoir engineering  
- Data analytics  
- Machine learning for subsurface datasets

It will grow over time as part of my structured 30-day portfolio development plan.
